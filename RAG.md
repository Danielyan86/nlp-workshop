# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Knowledge Sharing

## 1. Why Do We Need RAG?

### 1.1 Limitations of Traditional LLMs

- Hallucination issues
- High cost for fine-tuning
- Privacy concerns with sensitive data

## 2. Use Cases for RAG

### 2.1 Enterprise Applications

- Internal knowledge base chatbots
- Legal document analysis
- Medical research assistance

## 3. RAG Architecture and Principles

### 3.1 Basic Components

basic concept:

1. Embedding Model: Converts text into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning
   - Processes entire text chunks, not just individual tokens
   - Captures contextual relationships between words
   - Generates fixed-length vectors regardless of input size
2. Vector Store: Database for storing and searching vectors
3. Tokenization: Preprocessing step that breaks text into tokens (words/subwords)
   - Occurs before embedding
   - Helps handle out-of-vocabulary words
4. Semantic Understanding: Embedding models capture meaning beyond just word presence

5. Document Processing Pipeline

   - Local Documents: Source materials to be processed
   - Unstructured Loader: Converts various document formats into text
   - Text Splitter: Breaks documents into manageable chunks
   - Text Chunks: Smaller segments of text
   - Embedding Model: Converts text into vector representations
   - Indexing: Organizes vectors for efficient retrieval
   - Vector Store: Database for storing and searching vectors

6. Query Processing Pipeline

   - Query: User input or question
   - Embedding Model: Same model used to convert query to vector
   - Query Vector: Vector representation of the query
   - Vector Similarity: Compares query vector with stored vectors
   - Related Text Chunks: Retrieved relevant context

7. Response Generation
   - Prompt: Template combining query and retrieved context
   - LLM: Large Language Model for generating responses
   - Answer: Final response based on context and query
